  <h2> What is UX Design? </h2>
  <p>User experience design, commonly known as UX design, is the process of creating a meaningful and relevant product centered around the needs and desires of a target audience. In other words, UX design is designing how a user <em>interacts</em> with a product.</p>
  <div class="bottom">
    <p> The role of a UX designer involves research. They must understand how their target audience thinks and feels and how certain features can elicit specific reactions from them. UX design isn't just a one-time solution; it is an ongoing process involving continuously gathering data and user feedback to ensure that the product continues to satisfy expectations as users' needs evolve. </p>
    <p> UX designers must advocate for their users’ needs throughout all stages of the design process. They must understand their audience well to develop the best solutions to address their habits, needs, and concerns. </p>

  <h2> What is UI Design? </h2>
  <p>User interface design, also known as UI design, focuses on consumers' aesthetic and functional experience. In other words, they create the look and feel of an interface. It is the job of the UI designer to bring the UX designer's vision to life to ensure the creation of a product that is both easy and pleasing to use.</p>


<div class="bottom">
  <p>UI designers oversee the colors, text, font, spacing, images, buttons, and all interactive elements of a site. Therefore, UI designers must have a strong understanding of design principles to represent concepts and ideas in a way that is easy for the target audience to understand. They must work with the site's framework to develop a design that is functional, attractive, and aligned with all brand elements on the page.</p>

  <h2> Why is UX/UI Design Important? </h2>
  <p>By understanding what drives human behavior, UX and UI designers can design websites and applications that evoke positive experiences and responses from users. Research shows that good UX and UI design improves a consumer's experience and increases sales, user loyalty, and brand equity. <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coach-courses-us/public/theuxschool/uploads/The_Trillion_Dollar_UX_Problem.pdf">The Trillion Dollar UX Problem</a> states that for every  $1 invested into UX design, businesses average $100 in return. In other words, UX and UI design can help increase return on investments (ROI). </p>

            <ul class="bullet">
            <li>The first step of the design process is gathering data; this involves directly speaking to the target audience to gather information from them. The data can be either qualitative, quantitative, or both. Research allows designers to understand their target audience more and determine the issues they have and the solutions they are seeking. It also enables researchers to see what their competitors are doing to determine what needs to be done to differentiate themselves more from their competition.</li>

          <li class="pt-3 mainBullet" id="2"> Design
            <ul class="bullet">
              <li>After analyzing the research gathered in the previous step, this stage is where designers begin to brainstorm potential solutions for users. This may involve sketching ideas, toying with colors, and changing the interface and structure of the site.</li>
							<li>The design stage is where the UI designer comes into play. They help determine color palettes and where buttons, images, and content should be placed. They help UX designers with creating wireframes to help envision what the final product may look like. This step results in multiple sketches and wireframes. Further feedback from key decision-makers and more user testing is needed to determine which design to proceed with, which is done in the next stages.</li>

The purpose of this stage is to save time and money to ensure the final product is something consumers want and need.</li>

  <h2> Conclusion </h2>
  <p>UX and UI design are used interchangeably, yet they encompass different roles in the design process. While it is vital to understand their differences, it is just as important to realize that you cannot have one without the other. Good UX depends on good UI and vice versa.
