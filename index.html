  <h2> What is UX Design? </h2>
  <p>User experience design, commonly known as UX design, is the process of creating a meaningful and relevant product centered around the needs and desires of a target audience. In other words, UX design is designing how a user <em>interacts</em> with a product.</p>
  <div class="bottom">
    <p> The role of a UX designer involves research. They must understand how their target audience thinks and feels, but also how certain features can elicit specific reactions from them. UX design isn’t just some one-time solution; it is an on-going process that involves continuously gathering data and user-feedback to ensure that the product continues to satisfy expectations as a user’s needs evolve. </p>
    <p> UX designers must advocate for their users’ needs throughout all stages of the design process. They must understand their audience well to develop the best solutions to address their habits, needs, and concerns. </p>

  <h2> What is UI Design? </h2>
  <p>User interface design, also known as UI design, focuses on the aesthetic and functional experience of consumers. In other words, they create the look and feel of an interface. It is the job of the UI designer to bring the UX designer’s vision to life to ensure the creation of a product that is both easy and pleasing to use.</p>


<div class="bottom">
  <p>UI designers oversee the colors, text, font, spacing, images, buttons, and all interactive elements of a site. Therefore, UI designers must have a strong understanding of design principles to represent concepts and ideas in a way that is easy for the target audience to understand. They must work with the framework of the site to develop a design that is functional, attractive, and aligned with all brand elements on the page.</p>

  <h2> Why is UX/UI Design Important? </h2>
  <p>By understanding what drives human behavior, UX and UI designers can design websites and applications that evoke positive experiences and responses from users. Studies have shown that good UX and UI design not only improve a consumer’s overall experience, but also increases user sales, their probability to return (and become loyal consumers) and brand equity. In fact, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coach-courses-us/public/theuxschool/uploads/The_Trillion_Dollar_UX_Problem.pdf">studies show</a> that for every $1 invested into UX design, business on average receive $100 in return. </p>
  <p>Businesses that keep consumers in the center of the design process experience the most satisfaction and returns than those who don’t.</p>
